# Bench firmware validation — 30 October 2026

## Passed

- Full target build for `Seeeduino:nrf52:xiaonRF52840Sense` using Arduino CLI 1.5.1, Seeed nRF52 Boards 1.1.13 and native Apple Silicon Arm GNU 13.2.Rel1 / GCC 13.2.1.
- Bundled libraries: Adafruit TinyUSB 1.7.0 and Servo 1.1.2. No separately installed Servo library is used.
- Target size: **50,224 bytes flash / 7,704 bytes global RAM**.
- Native Arduino ctags 5.8-arduino11 built from official source. The local cached source renames the reserved `__unused__` macro to avoid a collision with current macOS SDK headers. This cache is excluded from git.
- Host tests against the actual sketch: disarmed boot, explicit newline arming, exactly 1500 µs commands, one selected PWM output, timed power-off, serial disconnect shutdown, immediate stop, malformed/overlong input, timer rollover and PWM attachment failure.
- VS Code task JSON, Python syntax and whitespace checks.

The newer native linker prints warnings for unimplemented POSIX file-descriptor/syscall stubs in Newlib. The build succeeds; this sketch does not use those POSIX interfaces. The vendor UF2 conversion script also emits a Python regex-escape warning. Neither warning was suppressed.

## Hardware status

The connected USB device is identified as **Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense** (VID 2886 / application PID 8045). The user confirmed the battery is unplugged and both horns are off.

**Firmware upload confirmed:** after entering bootloader USB PID **0045**, the native Python uploader flashed the compiled DFU package and returned **`Device programmed.`**. A subsequent USB check received **`ROBOT SERVO CENTER 0.1`**, the command menu and **`OFF.`**. The verification sends only `help` and `off`, both disarming commands, and closes the serial connection afterward.

Bootloader mode was identified by USB enumeration; the user did not observe the expected pulsing red LED, so LED appearance alone was not used as the readiness check. An earlier attempt in application mode timed out. Adafruit-nrfutil can return process status zero despite a failed upload; the project upload script therefore requires its explicit positive acknowledgement.

The bundled Servo implementation was inspected: its 20 ms period is 50 Hz and its 8 µs duty resolution rounds a 1500 µs request down to approximately 1496 µs. Host tests check the requested value, not physical pulse timing.

No servo power-on command has been sent. No motor movement, electrical voltage measurement, PWM timing measurement, low-voltage cutoff test or mechanical fit test has been performed by the agent. Host tests do not verify physical D2 voltage or a correctly wired Pololu switch. Verify VIN, 3V3 and disabled VOUT with a meter before the first powered servo command.

Re-run software checks with:

```sh
python3 scripts/robot.py test
python3 scripts/robot.py build
```
